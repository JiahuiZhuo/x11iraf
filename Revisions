X11IRAF V1.0 Notes File
Begun 6 Mar 1997
-----------------------

X11IRAF.tmpl
	Removed a /* from the comment causing aix to complain

ximtool/Imakefile
	Removed the !@#^% app-defaults install
	Change man page install, wasn't working on Solaris

ximtool/load.c
	Removed a qsort call and replaced with a local string sort, avoids
	crashes on various platforms

ximtool/ximtool.c
	Fixed -memModel and -fifo_flag bugs

ximtool/ximtool.gui
ximtool/ximtool-alt.gui
	Minor mod to workaround Layout crash on alpha.  Also changed "Close"
	buttons to be "Done" so all subpanels are consistent.

ximtool/save.c
	Added a missing arg to sprintf causing a segvio.

obm/widget.c
	Changed encoding of obm pointer address for do_text to %lx since
	pointers on the alpha overflowed the %x and the pointer was lost.

ximtool/ximtool.c
	Fixed a bug w/ the -fifo flag

ximtool/ximtool.gui
ximtool/ximtool-alt.gui
	Defined width for TextButton widgets to workaround bug on Xterminals.

ximtool/eps.c
	Fixed a missing grestore causing problems for Digital PrintServer 17
	printers.

ximtool/ximtool.c
ximtool/ximtool.man
ximtool/ximtool.html
ximtool/ximtool.ps
	Fixed a bug preventing the resource command line args from actually
	taking effect.  Also clarified the explanation of the ximprint.cfg
	file, regenerated postscript man page.

xtapemon/xtapemon.man
xtapemon/xtapemon.ps
	Following a user suggestion moved the discussion of the amount of
	tape used being acurately calculated from the BUGS section to the 
	DISCUSSION section since it will usually be the case that the count
	will be incorrect unless MTEXAMINE is used to position the tape, this
	wasn't as obvious before.  Regenerated postscript man page.

obm/ObmW/LayoutP.h
xaw3d/LayoutP.h
	Changed the XtMalloc call for creating new objects to XtCalloc calls
	so values are properly initialized. Fixes OSF V3.2d1 bug.

ximtool/fitsio.c
	Ifndef AIXV3 for typedef uchar 'cuz it was conflicting

---------------------------
V1.0 Patch-1 release 4/5/97
---------------------------

xgterm/main.c
	Undef'd memove for SunOS and X11R6 systems

ximtool/load.c
	For large directories the message containing the directory listing
	was overflowing the xim_message static buffer, modified to call
	OBM directly. 

ximtool/ximclient.c
	Fixed a typo in the page size setting page orientation.

ximtool/ximtool.gui
ximtool/ximtool-alt.gui
	Added "send <widget> activate" msgs to the main display and colorbar
	widgets so the saved cursor position is intialized in the widget.  If
	this is not done a WCSLAB will sample the cursor before beginning the
	display causing the widget to restore unitialized positions which can
	blow away the app with a server error.

ximtool/iis.c
	Added IIS packet debugging output triggered by a DEBUG_IIS env var.

ximtool/iis.c
	Removed some code related to setting the fbconfig in the special
	case of fbconfig=1 and the window not the same size as the frame
	buffer.  This was apparently done originally when experimenting with
	resizing the window automatically but that was abandoned and this		code was never removed.  It causes a bug in displaying to an un-
	initialized frame.

ximtool/ximtool.h
	Changed FBCONFIG_ENV2 from 'XIMTOOLRC' to 'IMTOOLRC' (6/1)

ximtool/irafio.c
	Modified to handle new OIF V2 images. (6/8)

ximtool/newimtool.gui
	Deleted windowRGB translations. (6/11)

ximtool/iis.c
	Fixed a missing pair of braces. (7/9)

ximtool/ximtool.c
	Fixed a bug in the -nframes flag (7/9)

obm/ObmW/Gterm.c
ximtool/ximtool-alt.gui
	Implemented magnify marker and cursor movement keystrokes for alt gui.
	Fixed bug in scaling raster zero cursor values causing keystroke
	moves to 'jump', change in get_draw_context() (7/11)

ximtool/eps.c
ximtool/eps.h
ximtool/ximtool.gui
ximtool/ximtool-alt.gui
	Fixed BoundingBox errors and unmatched grestore preventing inclusion
	of images in AASTex docs (8/6)

ximtool/ximtool.gui
ximtool/ximtool-alt.gui
	Added Shift-MB2Up translation to turn off crosshair when button 
	released. (8/6)

ximtool/ximtool.c
	Added "-rv" toolkit flag. (8/22)

ximtool/ximtool-alt.gui

	lations to markers. (8/22)

	Added the Virtual XImtool dummy server (8/22)

obm/ObmW/Gterm.c
	Fixed a bug in GtSetMapping which wasn't returning a success value,
	caused an evaluation error on HP  (8/26)

obm/ObmW/Gterm.c
	Fixed a bug in refresh_destination() in which only the left side of
	an image would be displayed if the FB was bigger than 512x512 and
	memModel=beNiceToServer.  (8/27)

obm/ObmW/Gterm.c
	Fixed a bug in scale_intzoom in which a beNiceToServer memModel would
	display odd zooms factors w/ a yflip. (8/27)

ximtool/ximtool.man
ximtool/ximtool.html
	Misc. typos.  (8/28)

Imakefile
ximtool/ximtool.gui
ximtool/ximtool.html
	Changed version to V1.1 set release date as 9/1/97?  (8/28)

ximtool/Imakefile
	Modified to automatically build a separate ximtool-alt binary.
	Eventually one or the other GUI should be used as the default so
	for now there are copies of the needed files and each binary builds
	from a different list, but the directory should be cleaned up when
	the new features are added permanently (8/28)

obmsh/Imakefile
obmsh/obmsh.man		+
	Added a man page for the task (8/28)

ximtool/raster.c
	Fixed an off-by-one bug in the computation of the center when doing
	an integer zoom.  Caused a one pixel boundary on two sides of a
	hardcopy plot (8/29)

ximtool/ximtool-alt.man
ximtool/ximtool-alt.html
	Added documentation for the alt GUI. (8/29)

	the right flags. (9/10)

ximtool/Imakefile
ximtool/eps.c
ximtool/fitsio.c
ximtool/gifio.c
ximtool/irafio.c
	Digital Unix 4 now defines a uchar typedef so had I had to define
	an OSF1 flag to workaround the local typedefs causing compiler errors.
	(9/10)

xpm/Imakefile
xaw3d/Imakefile
	Needed to add a 'all' target specifying the library to be built.
	On AIX these Imakefiles create an enpty all target and the library
	is skipped since it thinks the (empty) target is up to date. (9/10)

vximtool/vximtool.c
	Need to ifdef include <sys/select.h> for AIX (9/10)
